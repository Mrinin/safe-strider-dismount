Safe Strider Dismount!

When trying to dismount a strider while over lava, this datapack prevents you from getting off!

If you really want to burn on lava for some reason, you may hold the sneak key to bypass this datapack.

Made with the new `/ride` and `/execute on` commands in 23w03a. Will be updated in further snapshots if syntax changes.
